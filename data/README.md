# Data Directory

This folder stores **synthetic or user-provided** media for local testing. No real biometric data should be stored here.

Guidelines:
- Use small, non-sensitive sample assets (e.g., procedurally generated images or waveforms).
- Clean the directory after demonstrations to avoid unintentional retention.
- Keep large datasets out of the repository; mount them at runtime if needed.
